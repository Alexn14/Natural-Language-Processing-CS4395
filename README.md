The program takes in the data file and splits into lines, which then get split into strings each being a specific detail like last and first name. Based on the order of the strings, it adds in the information of a person into a Person object and formatted before doing so. The Person objects then get appended to a dictionary with the id being the key, which can then be submitted to a pickle file.
The program takes in a sys.arg as the file name, and can then be run. 
Python has a simpler and easier to read syntax, which allows for shorter code and easier implementation of packages. The main weakness to me at least is that python is not my strongest language which slows down development slightly.
Most of it was review, I have not used regex in python or pickle, but they were overall straight forward.
